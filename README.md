### Project title

Moody Jay 

### What and why?

Moody Jay intends to offer users with detailed slide bars where users can enter their mood, and recommends / auto-plays a playlist that suits the person's preference. <br />
We encounter many personalized playlists when we use spotify, youtube, etc, but it always occured to me that often they don't match my need. I was searching for ways in which the playlist could be more 'personalized', and came up with this solution.

### For whom?

The end-users will be people like me, who loves to listen to music and find new musics through playlists. <br />
Studies show that Gen Z finds personalized experiences appealing, and are willing to give their datas for it, so they will be our main target, too.

### How?

It is an web app where user could first enter their mood, and the app generates a playlists accordingly.

- The key here is to have multiple optional fields where users could express their complex feelings. One would be slide-bars for moods.
My idea for now is to use Spotify API for recommendations, but will have to look more into it.

- The playing feature itself has to be executed through external streaming service due to copyrights.
- It may be interesting to have auto-generated cover image or title for the playlists(through other APIs), but will have to look more into it.
- The user could login and save/share any playlists they think are worthy of saving.
- They could also customize the generated playlist.

While this is the general idea for the project, the details are open to change.

### Scope

Challenges would be
- The application will require authentication features and a database accesss to keep the user's saved playlist.
- Since we are working with people's mood, there sould be many iterations where we recieve feedbacks from multiple end-users.
- We will have to look deep into multiple APIs to have our main feature functional. 

Perhaps having a AI set up for recommendation would be too challanging. We are using APIs which allows us to focus more in other features.
